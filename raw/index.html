		<h3>Should I Be a Gaming Programmer?</h3>
		<small>Post by Lockhead on jan 06</small>
		<p><strong> Gaming programmers</strong> help write and code the software for video games. In your job, you'll typically be part of a collaborative creative team that includes game designers and artists. Your work will primarily be in the area of coding, which tells the computer or system what to do for the game to be played.</P>
<p>As a gaming programmer, you might design core game features, oversee game testing and conduct design reviews. You could also work in production, artistic concept, and game play. This career allows for great creativity, but the competition for jobs is intense.</p>
<p>It is also important for game programmers to understand linear algebra and basic algorithms.</p>
<p>video game programming will typically include classes in C++, calculus, object-oriented design, game algorithms, computer graphics, and network fundamentals.</p>
<p> Success Tip:
To increase the chances of finding an entry level position, get an internship first. One of the most effective ways for new programmers to gain the experience needed for an entry level position is to get an internship. Some of the companies that offer positions for interns include Volition Inc, EA Games, Insomniac Games, and LucasArts. Companies seeking interns typically require that their recruits have skills in C++, 3D graphics, artificial intelligence, and physics as well as strong problem-solving skills.</p>

    Action-adventure is a hybrid genre, and thus the definition is very inclusive, leading it to be perhaps the broadest genre of video games, and can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow genres. Typically, pure adventure games have situational problems for the player to solve, with very little or no action. If there is action, it is generally confined to isolated minigames. Pure action games have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenge the reflexes. Therefore, action-adventure games engage both reflexes and problem-solving, in both violent and non-violent situations.">action-adventure game</abbr></a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_North" target="_blank"><abbr title="Rockstar North Limited (formerly DMA Design Limited) is a British video game development company and a studio of Rockstar Games based in Edinburgh.

During its early years, DMA Design was backed by its publisher Psygnosis, primarily focusing on Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64 games. During this time, they created successful shooters such as Menace, and Blood Money, but it soon turned to platform games after the release of Lemmings in 1991, which was an international success and led to several sequels and spin-offs.
